This is something I built for fun and I hope it's useful for anyone learning how to build a basic game with SwiftUI.

This project was made as an homage to Minesweeper. Bearsweeper is a project I made as a challenge to see if I could build Minesweeper from scratch, without looking at any tutorials. I made the iconic smiley face a bear and the mines bees to keep me entertained. The idea is that the bear would be trying to get honey from a beehive without getting stung.

## What's Next
Here’s what I’d like to add to this project in the near-future:
* Two more game types: intermediate and expert. Currently the game only supports beginner mode (10 rows by 6 columns and 10 bees).
* Ability to save your time/personal best.
* Automatic saves of the amount of games you’ve won.
